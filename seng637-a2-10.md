# 1 Introduction
This exercise involved the implementation of JUnit testing for two Java classes within the Eclipse development environment. The initial steps included configuring the project and incorporating the necessary JFreeChart JAR files. Additionally, participants gained proficiency in navigating the Eclipse environment and became acquainted with setting up and executing JUnit tests.

Furthermore, the team actively engaged with Java Documentation, acquiring the skill to interpret and understand the functionality of the code. This process included delving into the documentation to discern the intentions behind each function as elucidated by the original developer. This comprehensive approach not only facilitated a thorough comprehension of the codebase but also provided insights into the rationale and design choices made by the initial developer.
